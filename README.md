# SQL_Samples

This repository contains a number of SQL scripts that I have written over the years for various purposes. 

This repository contains the following scripts:
- CreateTicketDB.sql -> Creates DB Tables for an internal ticketing application I wrote. Uses SQLITE engine.
- GenerateUID.sql -> A stored procedure for creating User Accounts in Active Directory.
- TempPWDGen.sql -> A depricated stored procedure for generating Temporary Passwords.
- SubrequestItem.sql -> A sample of one of the scripts used to manage and provision user accounts.
- SubrequestTrace.sql -> A set of testing scripts for debugging the above SubrequestItem scripts.
